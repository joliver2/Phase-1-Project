# Crypo Index

Crypto index is a simple web application that gives you information on 100 different cryptocurriencies. They are listed in order of popularity when the page loads as "cards." To find more info on a coin search the coin's name in the search bar at the top of the page.

Main page coin info:
Current price
Price change (24hrs)
Price change % (24hrs)

Searched coin info:
Current price
Price change (24hrs)
High price (24hrs)
Low price (24hrs)

## Usage

When this page is refreshed it grabs the most recent data from the Coin Gecko API to update cryptocurrency information. You can get more information on each coin you are interested in by searching that coin in the search bar. There is also a floating "refresh" button that will also update the page and refresh current cryptocurrency info.
